    If one can follow these key points in his/her design . He or she can make great design . Then give some example of
    how to use canve . This is the basically gist of the first course .
    For the secound course he mainly focus on freelancing stuff . How we can earn from canva .
    For these we have to target a instagram page or facebook page with a decent amount of follows but unorganised work .
    So we have to msg them directly that we can maintain their account .
    At first we have to work for free . Besides this we can upload our work in fiverr , upwork etc . this is the gist of
    the second course .
